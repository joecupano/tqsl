TQSLLIB changes
===============

2.5
---
Don't allow illogical combinations of CQ and ITU zones in a station location.

Allow cr-delimited Cabrillo files (files from very old Mac apps).

Be more aggressive about deleting a corrupt upload database. If a get or put
returns EINVAL (Oracle-speak for corrupt database), close and delete it before
returning an error.

Don't generate a warning for an already uploaded QSO where the changes are
only cases where previously omitted station location details were added. For
example, adding a CQ Zone to a station location that previously omitted it.

Return true for the expiry check for callsign certificates where
the certificate has an invalid serial number.

Add initialization for legacy crypto provider for OpenSSL to allow
TQSL certificate algorithms to work.

Update Cabrillo values for 2mm and 2.5mm bands to accept various
band names (119G, etc.)

Update tqsllib docs, new jquery.js to avoid ClamAV warning

When handling a log in update mode, and the callsign changes, don't 
default to the first DXCC entity for that call - use the selected
DXCC entity from the log.

Correct list of ADIF type specifiers. TQSL was expecting "C" when "S" is
the correct specifier for a String field.

Accept "AO-07" for Satellite AO-7.

Fix handling of Oblast "YN" where LoTW uses an incorrect "JN" abbreviation
internally so that "YN" isn't called out as a mismatch.

When reporting errors in ADIF input files, TQSL would report the line number
of the "eor" (end-of-record) marker, not the ADIF field having the error. TQSL
now reports the actual input line when that is possible.

TQSL could crash if a log being signed in update mode changed the DXCC entity
such that the zones were no longer valid. TQSL now changes those to "none" if
there is no match.

When processing a "QSO" record in a Cabrillo file that's badly formatted - no
band or callsign, for example - TQSL would loop on the same bad record until
terminated. TQSL now reports the error and ignores the QSO.

Fix handling of "QC" where LoTW uses the older "PQ" abbreviation internally
so that QC isn't called out as a mismatch.

Allow full administrative subdivision names so that loggers that emit
"New York" versus "NY" in a MY_STATE field will be accepted.

When comparing DXCC grid sets (multiple grids due to operating on a
boundary between gridsquares) allow the grids to be in any order and
still match.

Allow ADIF parser to return arbitrary ADIF fields.

Update to latest LoTW configuration file.

Callsigns, counties, etc. should not be case sensitive. Upper case
before using.

Don't issue error when CA cert has expired when importing a .p12 file.
(Or silently fail.)

Fuzzy match county names to allow existing variations to work.

Ignore OWNER_CALLSIGN as that's not intended to be used as any kind of
call used during an operation, it's who owns the station.

Prioritize callsign search to try to use OPERATOR.

Ignore non-calls in STATION_CALLSIGN and OWNER_CALLSIGN.

Don't complain about logs providing data that is empty in the station
location. Just use the data from the log.

Fix callsign certificate selection while signing to also check for
matching DXCC entity. This fixes the problem where the wrong callsign
certificate is chosen for a call with callsign certificates for multiple
DXCC entities.

Allow leading zeroes in MY_CQZ and MY_ITUZ.

Strip leading and trailing whitespace in ADIF field data

Attempt to recover from Unicode/UTF-8 format Cabrillo files by ignoring
the extra bytes before the "START-OF-LOG" signal.
`
Ensure that expired or otherwise invalid certificates in the chain
verifying a user Callsign Certificate are properly reported. This
fixes an issue where in some cases (TQSL on Mac) trying to install an expired
callsign certificate (an out-of-date TQ6 file), would cause an unexpected
error "unable to get local issuer certificate". 

If a BAND is provided for a QSO along with a FREQ, where that frequency
(or receive frequency) is outside the related ham band, ignore the FREQ
setting.

Move Deleted entities to the end of the DXCC list. Allow the "DELETED" text
in the entity name to be localized.

Check if TQSL is able to write to the working directory during start-up.

Improve the error message for missing private keys to be more descriptive.

Add the ability to map Cabrillo modes to user-specified ADIF modes
using the cab_modes.dat file in the TQSL user directory. File has Cabrillo
modes (two characters), then an ADIF mode, comma delimited. Default file is
provided by TQSL and users can provide their own.

Correct spurious error when "LIGHT" is used in Cabrillo files.

Fix error message for invalid receive band to reference the proper band
information.

Add functions for storing and retrieving station address data.

Force character set for ADIF and Cabrillo files to UTF-8.

Fix CMake config to use the right lib64 string on Linux.

Allow 'LIGHT' in a Cabrillo file to represent 300G and higher.

When there are multiple signature specifications in the configuration file,
choose the one with the highest version number.

Allow TQSL to build against OpenSSL 1.1.0.

Fix formatting of the messages that appear when QSOs change values in the
station location for duplicate QSOs.

Correct improperly formatted frequencies from ADIF files (values like
'7.010.20') to remove the extra periods.

Revert the change that stripped spaces in the TQSL configuration file as that
caused newlines to be removed in places like the station_data file.

Fix "OpenSSL error - bad end line" by ensuring that there's always a 
newline starting a new certificate.

Add the ability to pull DXCC Entity valid date ranges to the TQSL
configuration file.

Fix handling of the TQSL configuration file so that extra spaces are removed.
This corrects the defect that caused "NEW ZEALAND SUBANTARCTIC ISLANDS" to
appear first in the list of DXCC entities with Configuration File v9.2.

Update to permit build using OpenSSL 1.1 and later.

Allow "Light" mode QSOs in the 300 GHz and above band. Previously, TQSL
would reject these QSOs when either specified as a band in an Cabrillo
file ("300G") or as a frequency value in an ADIF file.

When an ADIF mode/submode pair doesn't match, try mapping the MODE field
using the user-provided ADIF map.

Update duplicates handling by using the QSO details (band, mode, date,
time, etc.) as the key and the location details as the related data.
Return the old and new location data when a duplicate is detected.

Correct defects that could cause callsign certificates to be improperly
deleted when new certificates are installed.

Fix handling of invalid callsign certificate passwords on OSX to display a
useful error message and allow the user to retry entering the password.

Allow build for Linux/BSD systems running older versions of Berkeley
DB by defining a potentially missing symbol.

Fix defect that could cause saving of private keys to be suppressed.

Accept C7 and 4Y as valid prefixes.

Display the serial number of the Callsign Certificate being processed
along with the callsign for errors when installing Callsign Certificates.
This allows errors to be specific when attempts to restore older
Callsign Certificates fail.

When installing multiple Callsign Certificates from a .tq6 file (such
as that available on the LoTW website) don't quit if a certificate
can't be installed due to a lack of a private key, as later callsign
certificates may be able to installed.

When deleting Callsign Certificates, store a copy so that certificate
can be recovered. Add the ability to list callsign certificates available
for restoration and a function that allows undeletion.

When deleting Station Locations, store a copy so that location can
be recovered. Add the ability to list station locations available
for restoration and a function that allows undeletion.

Correct typo that would cause duplicates database removal to fail
on Windows systems.

When processing an ADIF QSO, check that mode, band, date, and time
are all provided. Reject QSOs which do not have the required data.

Improve duplicates database open error handling. More cases should
be automatically corrected when the database is improperly formatted
or corrupted.

Update tqsl_isCertificateExpired and tqsl_isCertificateSuperceded to
work properly with key-only certificates.

Add tqsllib tracing information to the diagnostic log, making that
information more detailed and more likely to be useful for debugging
TQSL errors.

Report to the user when an update to the TQSL configuration file is
blocked because the "new" file has a lower revision level.

Use the ADIF 3.0.4 "SUBMODE" field when signing a log.

Add API to allow the call sign for a station location to be temporarily
specified. This allows locations with callsign='[None]' to be used
by selecting a call when signing a log.

2.4
---
Fix defect that doesn't allow adding station locations if only a single
callsign certificate is installed.

If duplicates database recovery efforts fail, delete it and 
recreate it.

Use online certificate status checks to ensure that a superceded
certificate is not selected even if the replacement certificate is
not installed on the local system.

Return errors when writing the station location data file to the user.
Also return errors for the callsign certificate data file.

Use a hash table for the duplicates database rather than a btree. The
format of the dupe records causes btree to perform poorly.

If the certificate status file can't be parsed, discard it and create a
new file.

Fix export of "key only" certificates to correct "Invalid argument" error.

Don't stop loading private keys just due to a file permission error in
the keys directory.

Add new functions to add and look up certificate status.

Clean up database log files on exit. Shrink the default log file to avoid
large amounts of wasted disk space.

When scanning the working directory for bad files, close the directory to
avoid file descriptor leaks.

Add some new bad callsign patterns.

Fix atoi() calls throughout to use strtol() so that strings like 012 aren't
treated as Octal due to the leading zeroes.

Default Cabrillo field to 8, not 5.

Fix OpenSSL workaround needed for 1.0.0c of OpenSSL so that it only applies
to that release, not later releases with the fix already in place.

Add new tqsllib APIs:
    Retrieve a named field from a station location
    Merge a station location definition into the database
    Add the ability to export station locations
    APIs to export and import certificates Base-64 encoded
    APIs to export and import duplicates database records
    Added an API to calculate the difference between dates

Verify that the BAND and FREQ fields are consistent. Disallow frequencies
outside of valid ranges for ham bands. This catches "10110" used (KHz)
versus the ADIF required 10.110 (MHz).

Always convert frequency values in Cabrillo logs to Megahertz
independent of contest type (HF/VHF).

Remove strcpy/strcat/sprintf and replace with strn* variants where possible.

Allow FREQ=0 when BAND is set. 

Try to deduce worked call field for unknown Cabrillo file contest
names.

Update mode mapping in Cabrillo files to pass FM through as is and
convert PH to SSB.

When trying to deduce call-worked field, ensure that anything that
looks gridsquare-like is skipped. Don't accept a log if there are 
two fields that look like callsigns.

Relax lower limit for 30m, 17m, and 12m bands to allow 10MHz, 
18MHz, and 24MHz to be allowed

Recover from invalid files in the working directory (symlink loops)
by detecting and removing them. These would cause database opens to
fail while searching for recovery logs.

Correctly handle permission problems and other system errors that occur
when opening station data and certificate files.

Strip spaces from entirely space-filled station location fields when
creating signing data. Prior versions of tqsllib would not properly
trim strings containing only spaces.

Remove code that was trying to remove unnecessary transaction log files
as that was causing duplicate detection to fail.

2.3
---
Add a mechanism to the location definition process to allow enforcement
of proper zone number combinations. A status message is returned to allow
the caller to report illogical selections.

Duplicate checking database. No changes necessary for existing code. However
new or updated code is strongly encouraged to enable duplicate checking
and commit or discard a particular signing instance as appropriate

tqsllib now built with MSVC on Windows. ABI compatility with the previous
MinGW-built version is maintained.

tqsllib and the rest of TrustedQSL now built with the CMake build system

Fixed several bugs, crashes, and potential vulnerabilities

** Windows 98 support has been dropped. This will be one of the last releases
to support Windows 2000. 

** This will be one of the last releases to support OS X on PowerPC systems.

2.2
---
Fixed bug in handling of certificates with
long serial numbers (typically root certs).

Added workaround for OpenSSL 1.0a bug.

2.1
---
Prompt user to save their certificate after importing a .tq6 signed certificate.

Fix filtering of superceded certificates so they are not displayed by default.

Don't allow certificate import to overwrite a newer certificate.

Require selection of states for US, provinces for Canada (with ability to
override when not appropriate.)

Handle Alaskan administratitive areas by allowing them to be selected while
outputting the correct county name in the station data exported with a signed
log.

Added support for specifying zone numbers for entities, states, and provinces 
Force proper zones for entities, states when possible.

Update configuration file to correspond to ADIF specifications for county names.

Ignore expired certificates during import/export when an expired CA
certificate is signed by a valid root cert.

Support OpenSSL 0.9 through 1.0 beta.

Fix security bug in certificate validation.

2.0
---
The Windows DLL has changed to use __stdcall. This makes it
incompatible with previous versions of the DLL, necessitating
a change in major version number.

openssl 0.9.6 or 0.9.7 is now required; earlier versions are
not supported.

1.6
---
Fixed a bug in the .p12 file generation under openssl 0.9.7.
Thanks to Kenji 'Joe' Rikitake, JJ1BDX for the fix.

Fixed a bug in tqsl_get_cert_ext that under some circumstances
caused return of unterminated strings.

1.5
---
Added MacOS support.
Converted build scripts to make full use of autoconf/automake.
Fixed some GCC 3.x compiler warnings.

1.4
---
Fixed bug in ADIF converter where input file wasn't being opened in
binary mode.

Several error conditions in tqsl_getConverterGABBI caused the converter
to loop on the same erroneous record.

1.3
---
Fixed a bug in the comparison of configuration file version numbers.
Added tqsl_verifyDataBlock function.

1.2
---
Added tqsl_getSatellite and tqsl_getPropagationMode config
functions.

Added support for conversion of ADIF BAND_RX, FREQ_RX, PROP_MODE
and SAT_NAME fields.

1.1
---
ADIF converter was rejecting BAND field > 5 characters, but the
valid 1.25cm value is 6 characters long.

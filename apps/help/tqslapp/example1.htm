<H3>TQSL Station Locations: an Example</H3>

This example illustrates an operator with two <A HREF="glossary.htm#station_location">Station Locations</a>: one for his home QTH, and one for a holiday operation in another DXCC entity.

Dave K1ZZ would be issued a <A HREF="glossary.htm#callsign_certificate">Callsign Certificate</a> for K1ZZ, and would define the following Station Location for his home QTH in Coventry, CT:

   <UL>
   <LI>a Callsign Certificate: K1ZZ</li>
   <LI>a DXCC entity: Continental US</LI> 
   <LI>a State: CT</LI>
   <LI>a County: Tolland</LI>
   <LI>a Grid Square: FN31tt</LI>
   <LI>a CQ zone: 5</LI>
   <LI>an ITU zone: 8</LI>
   </UL>
<P>   
Dave might name this Station Location <i>K1ZZ-Coventry</i>, incorporating both the callsign and the operating location for easy recall.
 
<P>If Dave were to operate occasionally from the US Virgin Islands, he would obtain a Callsign Certificate for KP2/K1ZZ specifying the US Virgin Islands as its DXCC entity, and then define a second Station Location for a QTH in the town of Cruz Bay on the island of St. John:

   <UL>
   <LI>a Callsign Certificate: KP2/K1ZZ</li>
   <LI>a DXCC entity: US Virgin Islands</LI> 
   <LI>a Grid Square: FK78oh</LI>
   <LI>a CQ zone: 8</LI>
   <LI>an ITU zone: 11</LI>
   <LI>an IOTA Reference Number: NA-106</LI>
   </UL>
<P>
This Station Location might be named <i>KP2/K1ZZ-CruzBay</i>, again incorporating both the callsign and operating location.
<P>
When using TQSL to digitally sign a file of QSOs made from his home in Coventry, CT, Dave would select his K1ZZ-Coventry Station Location. When using TQSL to digitally sign a file of QSOs made from Cruz Bay, Dave would select his KP2/K1ZZ-CruzBay Station Location. TQSL would use this information to <A HREF="glossary.htm#"digital_signature"">digitally sign</a> the file and optionally upload it to LoTW.

  <p><a name="adif" id="adif"></a> <b>ADIF</b> (Amateur Data Interchange Format) -- A log
  file format that many logging applications can export that describes one or more QSOs.
  It is not necessary to view or modify ADIF files in order to use <a href=
  "#TQSL"><strong>TQSL</strong></a> , but for more information, see <a href=
  "http://www.adif.org.uk/">http://adif.org.uk</a> .</p>

  <p><a name="cabrillo" id="cabrillo"></a> <b>Cabrillo</b> -- A log file format used for
  the submission of contest logs that describes one or more QSOs. It is not necessary to
  view or modify Cabrillo files in order to use <strong>TQSL</strong> , but for more
  information, see <a href=

  <p><a name="callsign_certificate" id="callsign_certificate"></a> <b>Callsign
  Certificate</b> -- A unique file issued to a user by the ARRL <a href=
  "certreq.htm">in response to a request</a> &nbsp;generated
  by the <strong>TQSL</strong> application&nbsp;that is used to <b>digitally sign</b> a
  log file, thereby confirming its authenticity. <strong>TQSL</strong> also enables you
  to view your Callsign Certificates and renew them before they expire.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  A cryptographic means of enabling a sender to convey information to a receiver in a
  manner that assures the receiver that</p>

<a name="LoTW_Account" id="LoTW_Account"></a><b>LoTW Account</b> -- the web page from which an LoTW user can
<ul>
<li>view the results of LoTW's processing of a digitally signed log file submitted to LoTW</li>
<li>view the status of each of your Callsign Certificates</li>
<li>view QSOs that have been submitted to and accepted by LoTW</li>
<li>view QSOs that have been confirmed by LoTW</li>
<li>view DXCC, VUCC, WAS, and WPX Award Credit</li>
<li>submit QSOs confirmed via LoTW for additional DXCC, VUCC, WAS, and WPX Award Credit</li>

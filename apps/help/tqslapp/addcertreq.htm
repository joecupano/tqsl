<H3>Requesting an Additional Callsign Certificate</H3>
<P>
When submitting a QSO to LoTW, you must present a <a href="glossary.htm#callsign_certificate">Callsign Certificate</a> that matches the station callsign
you used over the air when making the QSO. Thus if you've made QSOs using callsigns other than your present primary callsign, you'll need to request a
Callsign Certificate for each. This process is more straightforward and rapid than <a href="certreq.htm">requesting your Initial Callsign Certificate</a>
because your initial certificate is used to authenticate your request.
<p>
If you've already requested a Callsign Certificate for a callsign but have not yet received a response, don't initiate another request; doing so will invalidate the Callsign Certificate you requested, which may be in process or in transit. If you're concerned with the delay in receiving a response to your Callsign Certificate request, send email to LoTW-help@arrl.org  .
<p>
LoTW requires that you request an additional Callsign Certificate using the same computer with which you will accept that additional callsign certificate.
<p>
These instructions assume that  your <a href="glossary.htm#callsign_certificate">Callsign Certificates</a> reside in the folder <CODE>C:\MyLoTWCertificates</CODE> (if you've stored them in a different folder, adjust the instructions accordingly).
<p>
To request an additional Callsign Certificate,

<p>If you do not receive an email message bearing your Callsign Certificate after 3 business days, do not submit another Callsign Certificate request; instead, send an email message to LoTW-help@arrl.org inquiring about the delayed response.</P>

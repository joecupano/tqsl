Before submitting QSOs to LoTW, a user must <A HREF="certreq.htm">obtain</a> a unique <A HREF="glossary.htm#callsign_certificate">Callsign Certificate</a> from the ARRL, and define a <A HREF="glossary.htm#station_location">Station Location</a> that defines the location from which the QSOs were made.
<p>
To submit a QSO-bearing <A HREF="glossary.htm#log_file">log file</A> to LoTW, a user presents that file with his or her Callsign Certificate and Station Location to an ARRL-supplied application called <i>TQSL</i>. TQSL generates a <A HREF="glossary.htm#digital_signature">digitally signed</A> file, and optionally submits it to LoTW by uploading it over the internet. The Callsign Certificate authenticates the source of each uploaded QSO. In combination with  LoTW's double blind approach to QSO matching, which prevents users from seeing what other users have uploaded, this maintains the integrity of the QSO verification process that has long been the hallmark of ARRL awards.

<H3>Setting a Date Range</H3>
<P>
If the <A HREF="pref-opt.htm#daterng">Prompt for QSO Date Range</A> option is enabled, <b>TQSL</b> will display the <b>QSO Date Range</b> dialog to prompt you to specify a <b>Start Date</b> and 
an <b>End Date</b> when <a href="signupload.htm">Submitting a Log File to LoTW via the Internet</a> or
<a href="signupload.htm">Submitting a Log File from a Computer without Internet Access</a>. Any QSOs in the 
<a href="glossary.htm#log_file">log file</a> outside of this range will be ignored.
<P>
Dates should be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format:

<P>

<P>

Either date can be left blank, in which case only the other date is checked.
<P>

The <b>QSO Date Range</b> dialog can be used to prevent QSOs already submitted to LoTW that haven't been subsequently modified from being submitted again,
sparing LoTW from processing QSOs that have already been processed. For example, if the last log file submitted contained QSOs made
between 2013-02-20 and 2013-02-27, set the <b>Start Date</b> to 2013-02-27 and leave the <b>End Date</b> blank.Only QSOs made on 2013-02-27 
or later will be submitted.
<P>
Display of the QSO Date Range dialog <a href="pref-opt.htm">can be suppressed</a>, but this should only be done if you are <b>certain</b> that the QSOs being submitted 
have never been submitted before, or have been modified since they were last submitted.

TQSL changes
============
2.6.5
----------
Change the widget used for pulldown menus because Microsoft's windows 11 22H2 preview
broke them and Microsoft refuses to fix the bug.

Correct the portable callsign fix - it didn't work properly and didn't cover all cases.

2.6.4
----------
Handle both "KH6/K1MU" and "K1MU/KH6" forms of portable callsigns.

Checking for currently valid callsign certificates (change made in TQSL 2.6
"Validate a callsign certificate is still valid just before using it") causes
station locations with no selected callsigns to generate an error and fail to
sign the log. Correct this to bypass this check.

Correct a crash when TQSL detects a callsign certificate that's about to
expire during startup and the user selects "Yes" to renew that callsign
certificate.

2.6.3
----------
Handle the case where there's both a valid and an invalid callsign certificate
for a given call - don't error out when detecting the invalid one, continue
searching for a valid callsign certificate for the call.

Include the filename of the log being signed in the station location
verification page.

Don't do a ULS test when requesting a new callsign certificate which has an
end date. This allows requests for former callsigns.

2.6.2
----------
Add an option for new callsign certificate requests for club calls, QSL
managers, and DXpeditions.

Expand gridsquare input field to be long enough for four six-digit locators.

Allow properties of expired callsign certificates to be displayed from the
right click menu.

2.6.1
----------
Fix a major error in handing previously uploaded QSOs that can cause TQSL
to either hang or keep asking how to handle those QSOs.

2.6
----------
When defining a station location with only one park defined, do not force
that park to be selected. Default to "[None]" and allow that to be saved.

Don't allow renewal from a superseded callsign certificate. LoTW
won't allow that to work without a current signing certificate.

Remove the certificate type selection dialog. Explain what this was 
for - using a shared account for QSOs or a distinct one.

Add a log-handling preference that permits ignoring seconds in QSO
times to assist with discarding duplicate QSOs.

Allow command line signing without a station location being specified.

Handle station location setup with multiple certs for one call, moving
from an entity without a PAS into one with so zones get set correctly

Display full station location details when asking a user to validate
that the right station location is being used.

Validate a callsign certificate is still valid just before using it to
sign a log (requires network access to validate against ARRL).

Add separate folders under callsign certificate display to indicate status
of each cert (valid, expired, replaced, etc.)

Merge Station Location definition page to a single page.

Force proper zones when there's a single zone for ITU or CQ.


2.5.10 (unreleased)
----------
Provide directions for how to upload a log when "Sign and Save" is used.

When opening a Callsign Certificate file, show both TQ6 and P12 files. This
makes it more obvious how to choose a P12 (as it doesn't require changing
the file type pulldown.)

Export a copy of any imported Callsign Certificate.

Correct the sizing of the Callsign Certificate and Station Location property
windows.

Correct possible hang when displaying Callsign Certificate properties of
a pending callsign certificate.

2.5.9
----------
Fix problem that caused the TQSL preference for log handling to be ignored for
command-line operations and forced to "Report" handling.

Allow slashes in ADIF mode maps.

Remove forced background settings, allowing colors to default to system
settings.

Correct Chinese translation variants so Traditional and Simplified use the
right files.

2.5.8
----------
Add Chinese (Traditional) translation from SZE-TO, VR2UPU.

For Station Locations in places where there's only one CQ or ITU zone
value possible, don't allow a choice.

Add missed callsign certificate messages to those that can be translated.

Correct last QSO date information when displaying callsign certificate
properties. When there's no end date, report the date of the last QSO
that can be signed.

Verify the format of IOTA entries.

Create a TQSL backup automatically when new Station Locations are added or edited.

2.5.7
----------
Correct a crash when TQSL attempts to upload a file caused by a thread
accessing the GUI incorrectly.


2.5.6
----------
When importing a .p12 on the command line (-i call.p12), allow passing
the related passphrase on the command line as wel (-p "passphrase").

Use 'passphrase' versus 'password' when discussing protecting Callsign
Certificates. Change help from 'Postcard Password' to 'Postcard Validation
Code'. The only place password should appear is with reference to the Logbook
useraccount.

Add Swedish translation from Roger, SM0LTV.

Fix an error with command line handling introduced in TQSL 2.5.5 that could
cause formerly correct command lines to be rejected (specifically passing an
empty callsign certificate passphrase as -p "" rather than dropping the 
password option.

If a user is editing an ADIF file using the TQSL ADIF editor and closes the
editor window, TQSL would discard the file being edited. TQSL now asks the user
if the changes should be saved before closing the editor.

2.5.5
----------
When unable to find a match for a callsign certificate where the station
location is in DXCC Entity "None" don't suppress the entity name.

Fix issue on Windows systems when a TQSL update and a configuration file
update both show up at the same time. Randomly choose one or the other
for installation.

Ensure that all ADIF modes are available in the TQSL ADIF Editor.

Allow the TQSL ADIF editor to retain any ADIF field in the output. TQSL
doesn't allow editing all fields, but it no longer discards fields that
the editor does not handle.


2.5.4
----------
Add Catalan localization provided by Xavier, EA3W.

Correct the command line exit status values to properly reflect all QSOs
suppressed and some QSOs suppressed situations.

When looking up address information, use the DXCC entity number for the
callsign certificate to ensure the right address is retrieved.

Correct case sensitive callsign matches when comparing QSO data. This
corrects a defect where OPERATOR set to 'k1mu' would issue an error.

Loosen matching for US counties as there is no single source of
"proper" county names.

Fix issue where installing a new LoTW configuration file could
corrupt the DXCC entity names.


2.5.3
----------
Report on invalid data in ADIF fields - County misspelled, state in
the county field is wrong, zones incorrect for the Entity/State.

Ignore OPERATOR fields in an ADIF file if the value does not look like
a callsign.

Properly report callsigns where there are no callsign certificates
available for that call versus reporting this as a date range error.

Allow callsigns of up to 20 characters. Detect when a callsign is too
long.

2.5.2
----------
TQSL now issues an error message when an unrecognized file is loaded
as a callsign certificate file.

Do additional checks for ULS lookup failures to ensure that the data is
not corrupt. Add the last update date for the ULS database to the message
displayed saying that the ULS data is missing.

Report when TQSL is unable to open the files needed to connect to Logbook.

Allow ADIF log QTH data to override Station Location Details. Add a command
line option and a preference field to control this behavior.

Move the log signing preferences to a separate preference page to keep it
from growing too large.

When an ADIF log provides station details, detect mismatches and report
those when signing a log. This allows improperly chosen callsign certificates
and Station Locations to be detected.

When https (Secure) connections to Logbook fail, fall back to trying http
requests. This allows systems with anti-virus that interferes with network
connections to recover.

When fetching ULS data fails, do not reject callsign certificate requests -
allow those to work without address data.

Remove ULS check for US 1x1 callsigns.

Add diagnostic log lines suggested by David, W1HKJ.

Fix centering of date fields in the date range prompt dialog box.

Select the current language in the language selection dialog.

2.5.1
----------
Correct defect causing the entity name to not display properly when only
one callsign certificate was active.

2.5
----------
When installing a Callsign Certificate, don't display errors about expired
root certificates.

When listing DXCC entities, move the Deleted entities to the end of the list.
This helps with the confusion between "Germany (DELETED)" and "FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF GERMANY", especially for persons where English is not a primary
language. Allow the "DELETED" string in those names to be translated.

Eliminate the use of the term "duplicates" when referring to already
uploaded QSOs as that term means something else in normal usage.

When editing a Station Location, do not force default values for station
information fields. Only provide default values when a new station location is
being created.

Fix incorrect ADIF output for several modes when creating files using the
ADIF editor built into TQSL.

Use ARRL web service to validate US callsigns and pre-fill address info.

Fix TQSL updates failing on Windows when the user's home directory has
non-ASCII characters.

Detect running TQSL "As Administrator" and warn the user. Allow this warning
to be permanently overridden.

Verify that the TQSL working directory is writable during startup.

Disable prompting for callsign certificate password by default. Add a
preference setting to allow this to be re-enabled if desired.

Fix error that was not overriding station location details with the default
values when editing an existing station location.

Fix OSX error where the "Edit Station Location" icon was getting squashed.

Update "Waiting for Callsign Certificate" icon to a clock versus the slashed
circle. The latter was being interpreted as something broken versus something
to wait for.

Keep track of Callsign Certificate requests and reject attempts to request
certificates for the same callsign more than 3 times in 24 hours. This limit
will hopefully stop people from mistakenly re-requesting callsign certificates
repeatedly for the same call because they don't realize that action needs to
be taken by ARRL staff to complete the process.

Correct defect that could cause TQSL to crash upon exit while attempting to
back up.

When requesting US 1x1 callsigns, which always require signing, don't ask for 
a certificate type for the request. Require that the user have a valid 
certificate for some other call to proceed. Remove the "1x1" callsign option
from the certificate request type page.

When creating callsign certificates, ask for the type of certificate first
as that then drives the next set of questions to ask.

2.4.7
----------
Correct defect that keeps TQSL updates on Windows from working properly.

2.4.6
----------
Fix error messages for Windows command line users. The text was garbled due
to changes made to implement Unicode on Windows (no changes for Linux or Mac).

2.4.5
----------
Fix log messages for Windows command line users to not be a string of Hex
characters.

2.4.4
----------
Add localization for Turkish.

Add support for a 64-bit build for MacOS. Add an indicator of what platforms
are supported for an Mac build (i386/ppc or x86_64/i386).

Fix error that was keeping the State and County from being defaulted when
creating a new Station Location.

Add another callsign certificate request type - one for a new callsign for
the primary user.

Add language support for Polish. Fix problem that was keeping Hindi from
properly displaying on Windows.


2.4.3
----------
Fix defect that was causing steate/province/oblast to be reset to "None" when
editing a station location. This defect could also cause station location
details to be forced to be the default location data for the callsign, making
remote locations more difficult to edit.

2.4.2
----------
Ensure that the exit status message emitted by TQSL appears in English
so logging programs can use that to detect exit status.

Improve setting of ITU and CQ zones when defining a Station Location. There
were many cases where these were left empty.

Fix issue with Windows updates of TQSL failing when the user's directory
has a space embedded.

Language fixes:
Remove spurious error message when run on a system where the local
language is not supported. 

Allow adding translations without making code changes.

When displaying a callsign certificate where the private key is missing
from the local system, specifically state that the private key is not
found. Add a specific message for keys that cannot be opened.


2.4.1
----------
Display "No Private Key" versus an error message when displaying a callsign
certificate with no installed private key.

Fix defect that meant that some callsign certificates (those with missing
private keys) could not be restored from a .TBK file containing a good copy.

Fix defect that was causing callsign certificate renewals to have "null null
null" as the Name in some conditions.

Fix defect that was required deleting an existing callsign certificate before
importing a replacement .P12 file


2.4
----------
Add Hindi translation.

Pre-load callsign certificate requests from the ARRL address data when it
is available for a given callsign.

Provide default gridsquare, state, and county for station locations when
available from the ARRL address data. Validate that gridsquares are 
consistent with the station's address.

Retain all certificate private keys. Mark as deleted and allow them to be
recovered. This allows the .TQ6 file downloaded from LoTW to always be used
to recover a user's callsign certificate.

Allow LMDB to be used with TQSL to work around Berkely DB licensing issues.


2.3.1
----------
Update copyright messages to 2017.

Add the ADIF satellite name to the pulldown menu in the ADIF editor to allow
satellites to be more easily looked up.

Add 'Saving QSOs' to the messages to be translated.

Add Finnish translation from Juhani, OH8MXL.

When renewing a callsign certificate and backing up to earlier pages in
the wizard, don't display a spurious certificate type selection page.

When editing an ADIF file that has an invalid mode setting, notify the
user that it is being ignored.

Fix password prompt on systems with debug assertions enabled in wxWidgets.

Correct the invocation of the Windows Installer when an update is available.

Add a missing error message.

Correct the counts reported when duplicate QSOs are found along with QSOs
with other errors.

2.3
----------
Add Russian translation provided by Vic, US5WE.

Add Spanish translation provided by Jordi, EA3GCV.

Require the start/end date for new callsign certificate requests to be within
the valid range for the associated DXCC entity. Detect out of range dates and
report these errors to the user for correction.

Correct defect that could cause a spurious "this language is not supported"
error message on Linux systems without the English localization files
installed.

Fix build error using gcc-5/gcc-6.

Update Callsign Certificate request wizard to request information so that it
can determine if the request should be authenticated and, if so, suggest which
Callsign Certificate to use for authentication.

2.2.2
----------
Correct a defect that could cause TQSL to crash when a user restored
a callsign certificate from a .P12 file, created a .TBK backup, then tried
to restore a second callsign certificate.

When a new version of TQSL is available, install it rather than
providing a link to download the installer.

Add Chinese translations provided by Caros, BH4TXN.

Correct a defect that causes TQSL to crash when renewing a callsign
certificate and the user uses "Cancel" to exit the password prompt.

Provide a more informative error message when the private key for the
selected callsign certificate can't be read when displaying certificate
properties, signing a log, and using a certificate for signing another
callsign certificate request.

Fix TQSL infinite loop when attempting to export a callsign certificate
when the private key cannot be read. Instead of hanging, emit an error
message with details on the error and abort saving the certificate.

Update Japanese translations with those supplied by Aki, JL3OXR.

Update Italian translations with those supplied by Salvatore, I4FYV.

Correct language switching on Linux systems to not display spurious
error messages.

Update compilation flags to avoid relocation error on x86_64.

Correct compiler warning when building on Debian Jessie.

Update copyright messages to 2016.

2.2.1
----------
When running in batch mode (-x or -q on the command line, don't show the
upload progress bar, just do the upload.

When changing the selected language, ensure that the window position is
retained.

When TQSL is killed while in the process of signing/uploading a log, roll-
back the duplicates database changes and cleanly close the database.

When an old .TQ6 file is loaded into TQSL, and there was a valid private
key for that certificate, TQSL could incorrectly delete a private key
for a pending callsign certificate, causing installation of that certificate
to fail. TQSL now verifies that the certificate being installed is active
and will not delete certificates improperly.

Don't delete/recreate the main window when language selection doesn't change
the selected language.

Display warning that changing the status log display will require a restart.

Add "Replaced" and "Expired" indicators to callsign certificate properties
display.

Save preferences in .tbk files in numeric form so on/off preferences can
be transferred across operating systems (Windows/Mac/Unix) properly.

Ensure that the callsign certificate password window always appears on the top
of other windows. This will cause the main TQSL window to always appear when
prompting for a password.

Add enhancements to the ADIF editor. Select the proper band when a frequency
is being entered. Default to 160M when adding a new qso, and don't lose
changes when moving backwards from a record being added.

Correct memory leaks in station location handling.

Report old and new QTH details when a duplicate QSO is detected. Store and
restore the QTH data when duplicates data is processed in a backup (tbk) file.

Allow alternate UI layout that puts the status log on a separate tab. Use the
"Display status messages in separate tab" preference setting to enable this.
Changing this setting requires restarting TQSL for it to take effect. This
change will make handling large number of callsign certificates or station
locations easier.

Fix error that would cause installation of a new configuration file to fail
on systems with non-ASCII characters in the user's home directory name.

2.2
----------
widen fields for station location pages to accommodate long Park names. Permit
long label names for station location fields.

When renewing a password-protected callsign certificate, entering an incorrect
password would display "Error: Invalid argument" versus the expected error
relating to the incorrect password. TQSL now displays a "password not correct"
error and allows the user to try again.

Updates to correct portability issues for some Unix-based systems.

Correction for a defect that doesn't permit more than one field to appear on
a station location page that has dependent values.

2.1.3
----------
Revert change in the behavior for command line applications. TQSL
2.1 changed the behavior for ADIF files to open those with the
TQSL ADIF editor versus signing them unless "-x" or "-q" were on
the command line. This was an incompatible change that is not
consistent with the documentation and was removed.

Fix defect that could cause newly imported callsign certificates to
be deleted after the import completed.

2.1.2
----------
Add Portuguese (Portugal) translations from Nuno, CT2IRY. (A separate
Portuguese (Brazil) translation will eventually be needed.)

Correct command line parsing defect that causes TQSL to quit without
signing a log unless a station location is provided on the command line.

Correct the TQSL editor to not use the language settings for decimal
points as ADIF requires "." as the decimal separator.

2.1.1
----------
Correct defect that generated a spurious error message on certificate
renewals, which was entirely blocking renewals.

2.1
----------
Use German translations from Andreas, DF4WC.

Don't require selections for RX Freq, Propmode, or Satellite when entering
a QSO into the ADIF editor. Suggest ".adi" as the file type for the editor
when saving a new file, not ".adif".

Correct support for localalized characters in Windows usernames. Thanks to
Goran, SM4DHF for help with fixing this issue.

Recognize <SUBMODE:n> tags in an ADIF file and map those to modes that LoTW
supports.

Warn a user when they try to renew a callsign certificate when there's already
an existing certificate request for that callsign.

Describe the purpose of the TrustedQSL configuration file when a new version
of the configuration file is available for download.

Add menu items to the Station Location and Callsign Certificate menu to permit
undeleting of those items.

When creating automatic backups upon exit, save multiple generations (default
10 versions) with a timestamp. This makes it more likely that mistakenly
deleted callsign certificates and/or station locations can be successfully
recovered.

Update the UI for the ADIF editor to eliminate confusing behavior. Add
accessibility labels to the editor. Warn the user that editing an arbitrary
ADIF file within TQSL will cause fields to be lost.

Ensure that TQSL windows gain focus when they are initially displayed. This
eliminates a usability issue with accessibility tools.

Close TQ8 file when signing a log file. This fixes a defect that would cause
the file to remain open until TQSL exited.

Attempt to recover from "Self-Signed" certificate errors caused by some
misguided "anti-virus" products.

Correct defect that could cause TQSL to crash when a user issues a callsign
certificate renewal request at startup.

When unable to create a callsign certificate request, TQSL would be unable to
report the reason, displaying "NO ERROR". Provide the appropriate error
message under this circumstance.

When a certificate upload fails, pop up an error dialog with the details and
delete the pending certificate request. Also delete the pending certificate
request when the user cancels the creation.

Fix duplicated message text when duplicates are detected.

Clean up certificate upload messages.

When importing a new callsign certificate, delete any existing pending
callsign certificate requests, as well as any expired callsign certificates
for that call sign.

When displaying the properties of a pending callsign certificate, state that
it's pending ARRL action and suppress the fields that are always "N/A", such
as start/end date.

Remove redundant "You do not need an account" message on certificate renwals.

Support wxWidgets 2.9 and 3.0. TQSL is targeted for wxWidgets
2.8, but some Unix variants provide 2.9 (unstable) or 3.0.
TQSL will be updated to use wxWidgets 3.0 for the next release.

Allow QSO start/end dates to be for the next year when creating
a callsign certificate request. This allows requests for future
special event operations.

When creating a callsign certificate request, verify that the QSO
start date is before the QSO end date.

When signing a log from the command line in "batch" mode (with -x
specified), don't stall waiting on other copies of TQSL to complete
signing before processing the command-line log. Instead, report
an error message stating that the database is busy. This corrects
an issue where logging programs calling TQSL to sign a log could
appear to be "hung".

Update TQSL to be more tolerant of non-english characters in
file and directory names.

Allow station locations to have callsign unspecified ('[None]').
When you use such a location for signing a log, TQSL will search
for valid callsign certificates in that DXCC entity. If there is
only one such callsign certificate, that will be chosen for
signing the log. If there are multiple callsign certificates, TQSL
will present a list of possible callsign certificates to use, with
the  callsign certificate with the latest expiration date selected.

When submitting a log to LoTW, if you have defined exactly one
Station Location, TQSL will automatically use that Station Location
without prompting you to select it.

Add a command line option "-c callsign" that allows a logging
program to specify the callsign certificate to use when signing a log.
This can be used with "Callsign='[None]' locations, or to override
the callsign defined in a given station location. If the callsign
is not valid for the DXCC entity for the selected station location,
TQSL will issue an error and reject signing the log.

Further changes for accessibility improvements, including not using
changing text fields on dialog boxes to indicate errors.

Update TQSL to interact better with accessibility libraries. These
changes have been tested with MacOS VoiceOver.

Properly handle station locations with callsign set to "NONE". They can't
be used to sign a log, but they can be created and edited while waiting
for a valid callsign certificate.

Allow TQSL's messages to be translated to the local language.

When update checks are being performed and the Logbook website is not
reachable, don't keep trying after the initial failure.

Improve startup performance and performance with a large number of callsign
certificates.

Add the ability to localize TQSL by allowing translation of many of the
messages generated by TQSL.

2.0.3
----------
Correct defect that doesn't allow creating station locations when only one
callsign certificate is installed.

2.0.2
----------
When run in command line "-n" mode (display new program and/or configuration
files), TQSL could exit before the check was completed. Change the behavior
so the program waits for the check to complete.

Signing a log with a location that points to an incomplete certificate
request would cause an "Invalid argument" error rather than the expected
error message notify the user that they have no valid callsign certificates
for that callsign. TQSL now properly displays the error.

Don't display the main TQSL window when requesting the user enter
the password for their callsign certificate when in batch mode.

Add timestamps to diagnostic log entries.

Ensure that station locations added from the "sign a log" selection
dialog are added to the list of station locations.

Allow restore from a .tbk file to restore multiple pending callsign
certificates for a given callsign.

Change message on upload dialog box when a certificate request is being
uploaded to indicate that it's a callsign certificate request, not a
log file being uploaded.

When a renewed callsign certificate is installed, delete any older versions
for that callsign.

Correct defect that could cause errors when using files in directories
containing non-ASCII characters on Windows.

Correctly account for errors when signing a log so that the number of QSOs
processed is displayed correctly. (For some cases where QSOs caused errors
which the user chose to ignore, the number of QSOs processed could show up as
a negative number.)

On Windows, Use OpenSSL 1.0.1g to correct the Heartbleed bug.

Add a newline after "Signing using.." message when signing a log so
any errors show up under that message, not tacked onto the end of it.


2.0.1
----------
Lock the duplicates database so only a single TQSL instance can
access it in cases where users have multiple TQSL windows open.

Don't use the Directory chooser widget in the preferences pane for
selecting a backup directory on Linux systems. That widget is
not usable and can crash TQSL. Use a simple text box instead.

Don't prompt the user to renew a callsign certificate that's going to
expire soon if they've already submitted a renewal.

Correct handling of callsign certificates to avoid an "Invalid argument"
loop in some circumstances during update checking. 

Fix crash when the callsign certificate status file is empty or invalid.

Update the messages displayed during callsign certificate creation to
make it more clear when signed requests are appropriate. Warn when
a duplicate certificate request is being created that there are pending
operations and that the user should wait.

when checking for updated versions of TQSL, consider production releases
to be "newer" than beta/alpha test versions.

Correct defect in thread handling that causes hangs on pthread-based
systems.

Change handling of the Pending Callsign Certificate request list to avoid
using a function that misbehaves on some Linux variants.

When a user tries to sign a log using a Station Location that refers to an
invalid Callsign Certificate, refuse the signing operation and let the user
know that the Callsign Certificate is invalid.

For uploaded files, use .tq8 as the extension, not the original .adi/.log to
avoid user confusion.

Remove hang when certain command line strings are empty (-p, for example).

When editing a station location where there the associated callsign
certificate is no longer installed, don't default to the first certificate.
Display an error to properly notify the user.

Correct handling of Station Location names with leading and/or trailing
whitespace. Strip those characters when creating and editing a station
location and ignore them when looking up existing station locations.

Install and use a certificate bundle so TQSL is no longer dependent upon the
host OS for certificate validation. 

On Windows, use OpenSSL for SSL connections rather than the unreliable
Windows SChannel implementation.

Word wrap the "overlapping certificate" message properly.

Fix a crash that occurred when an error was displayed due to the
automatic backup being performed at exit.

Display errors that happen while saving creating callsign certificate
requests more prominently.

When prompting for a password, don't treat an empty password response
as a cancel. Try to use that and report a password error if appropriate.

When reporting errors, don't include the filename of the proximate cause
twice in the same error message.

Don't notify users of pending callsign certificate requests with the "are
you ready to install" prompt. This is confusing as it seems to indicate
that TQSL has the .TQ6 already downloaded and ready to install. Since we
can't tell when LoTW has delivered the e-mail, don't prompt for the TQ6
at every startup.

Use the LoTW certificate status web query to determine if any callsign
certificates are current. Store this information when updates are done
(by default, once daily) and use that to inform users that the
callsign certificate they are using are no longer valid.

Move the update operations performed at startup to a separate thread so
the GUI can initialize while this work is ongoing. This replaces the
2.0 behavior of starting the updates (and blocking the GUI) two seconds
after the GUI appeared. This also corrects a potential deadlock on
OSX where the first-time user message could appear along with an update
dialog, both of which locked each other out.

Correct callsign certificate password handling to use UTF-8 for any
new passwords. On Windows, try UTF-8 then UCS-2 to unlock.

Issue more helpful error messages when errors occur while parsing an
ADIF file, including what field is causing the error.

Correct problem where using characters like "<", ">" or quote in a station
location field could cause restoring a .tbk file to fail with a syntax
error.

Properly handle non-ASCII characters in station location names and in callsign
certificate request name/address fields. Store these in a form that allows
transport between UNIX and Windows.

When asking about how to handle duplicate QSOs, don't count duplicate QSOs and
QSOs with bad callsigns as "new" - ignore them.

When importing certificates, default to .tq6 files.

Force the callsign certificates and station locations pane of the UI to be
fixed size. This fixes long lists of certificates or locations to use a
scrollbar rather than having the pane stretch the whole UI.

2.0
----------
Major feature Additions:

Merge tqslcert into tqsl. Update the UI to be more user friendly.

For the Callsign Certificaates tree display, don't display the
certificate provider list if there's only one provider.

Allow users to back up and restore their TQSL configuration in a portable
file. Automatically back up the configuration to a user-specified directory
(or to a default one) unless this is disabled.

Add diagnostic logging capability. This is used to store a verbose log
from cURL and to write a trace log that can be used by the developers to 
help determine the source of defects.

Display unique icons in the certificate tree to allow expired and superseded
certificates can be distinguished.

Detect and report invalid frequencies in ADIF files (outside of ham bands,
entered in KHz versus MHz.)

Validate the format of Grid Squares when they're entered for a station
location. This also fixes the case to be normal, upper case for the Field,
lower case for the subsquare (FM18ju, for example).

Other changes:

Correct the defect that could cause invalid QSOs (bad call signs, for
example) to result in a cancellation message from an attempt to sign the
log but not provide detail on what QSO failed.

Automatically back up the user's configuration whenever TQSL closes.

Display the versions of the major software packages built into TQSL as part
of the "Help/About" text.

Don't ask the user to choose the file type for certificate load operations,
just provide a file open dialog and allow them to choose.

When issuing a callsign certificate request, default to "signed" unless there
are no usable certificates to be used to sign the request. Add text to the
dialog box explaining when unsigned requests should be used.

Remove the initial "Certificate Providers" page from the certificate
request wizard as it serves no current purpose.

Always display all callsign certificates, including expired and superseded
certificates.

Use consistent terminology throughout - "Callsign Certificate" and "Station
Location".

Replace atoi() calls with strtol() to correct parsing of strings like '012'
so they are not treated as octal.

Enforce frequency entry in the ADIF editor, ensuring that frequencies are 
entered correctly (in MHz) and within an amateur band. Reject frequencies
that are not consistent with the BAND setting.

Correct the exit code for circumstances when -a abort is used and an bad QSO
is detected. Display the error information on that QSO before exiting.

Detect new versions of the TQSL configuration file when performing the
"check for updates" operation (manual or automatic) and allow the user to
update the configuration file if there is a newer one available.

Add new command line options "-b" to select the start date for QSOs to be
signed (begin) and "-e" to select the end date for QSOs to be signed.

Warn users on startup when they have a certificate that's going to expire
soon (in less than 60 days).

Back up certificate details (address, entity) when backing up as .p12 file.

Change title of certificate request window to reflect new or renewed
certificate.

Add the ability to automatically upload a certificate request.

Make the preferences window a top-level window so it doesn't block
activity in the help screen, etc.

Delete obsolete mode maps when signing a log.

When creating a station location, default to the callsign selected on
the locations tree if one is selected.

Add a button to the Log Operations window that opens the Logbook of the
world website.

Add a new command line option, -n, which checks for new versions of critical
TQSL files then exits. This is designed for use by logging programs that
operate TQSL on behalf of the user.

Add network proxy preference settings to allow users to use the TQSL network
based functions on networks that require all traffic to use a proxy.

Grab window focus when prompting for the certificate password to ensure that
the password window appears on top of the calling logger.

Simplify the messages displayed on certificate import (relegate the details
to the diagnostic log).

Detect additional cURL errors and translate them into more user-friendly
text.

Don't use "Private Key" in certificate load error messages - use certificate
request. Provide the callsign associated with certificate loading errors.

Display detailed error on certificate import errors.

Display system error reason when attempts to update the TrustedQSL
configuration file fail.

Track multiple pending certificate requests and warn the user when they try to
ask for a new or renewed certificate for callsigns where requests are already
pending.

Fix pathname separators so Windows always uses "\" for folder/directory names,
not mixed forward and backward slashes.

Add more information to signing progress display including processed, error,
and duplicate counts.

Recover from invalid ADIF files by ignoring invalid data until the next EOR
(end of record) field is seen.

Add working directory string to diagnostic log.

Update documentation to reference differences for Mac OS X menus.

Delete pending log file when signing cancelled.

Fix crash when location entity data is missing.

Display the DXCC entity name in location properties, not the entity number.

Correct Grid Square parsing to allow 'a' and 'z' in subsquare fields.

Update documentation to reference Mac OS X GUI fields and menu layout.

Move Diagnostic Mode menu to File menu - the OS X Help menu doesn't allow
checked items.

Correct other instances of DXCC entity number being used in user messages
to emit entity name, not the number.

Generate an error message on startup when stale mode maps are in place.

Don't allow a user to redefine a standard mode.

When the user chooses to not ignore errors in a log, don't save or 
upload it.

Fix the way user dialog boxes (for things like date range, passwords, and
requests for how to handle errors) get instantiated so that the windows can
appear on top of logging programs using command line log signing.

Attempt to determine the field containing the call-worked data in unknown
Cabrillo contests without requiring the user to define a custom contest.

Update the "Ignore Errors" dialog to have "Ignore" and "Cancel" options
and to describe what each of those does.

Correct batch/quiet mode (-q or -x command line options) to avoid unexpected
windows from popping up before a dialog (password, errors, date range, etc.)

Always print out the TQSL version number at the beginning of output for
command line applications.

Use new application icons contributed by K1GQ.

Correct regression where duplicate QSOs would result in an action prompt
even though "-a abort" was specified on the command line.

Don't display the TQSL version number when "-n" is used on the command line.

Strip leading and trailing spaces from the location name passed on the
command line.

Properly handle and report upload errors displayed by the LoTW website.

Install TQSL icon when "make install" used on Linux.

Make the new icons optional.

Correct the suppression of the TQSL version number when "-n" is used
on the command line.

Report errors when critical files cannot be opened (station data,
certificates, etc.)

Correct the behavior when the user selects a callsign or a location in the
station location pane then clicks "Create new station location". The callsign
selected was used in the location setup, but the DXCC entity was not properly
selected.

Only display the DXCC entity once in the station location page. This fixes
the display when there are multiple callsign certificates for a given callsign
(one valid and one expired, for example). This defect would cause TQSL to show
a pulldown menu with multiple copies of the same entity name.

Suppress warning messages when the user has no locations defined or callsign
certificates installed as this is normal for an initial setup.

When "Sign and Save" or "Sign and Upload" are used, first check if the user
has any callsign certificates installed. The former behavior would ask for
the input and output files, then try to select a station location. Since
there are none, offering to create a station location would then fail.

Trim extra spaces from station location fields. These could cause
signing to fail as LoTW was removing these but TQSL was not.

Update TQSL to provide the current LoTW configuration file (v2.5)

Correct error messages on version update website failures, so that it's
clear that it was the check that failed, not the download. Increase the
version check timeout slightly to limit premature check failures.

When performing the automatic update check at startup, wait for the main GUI
window to appear. Provide a status message in the window until the update
check completes. This keeps TQSL from appearing to hang at startup if the
update check is slow.

Correct command line behavior to not pop up a window when invoked then
close that window. Fix duplicate handling error introduced at RC6.

1.14.3
------
On Windows, use a newer versions of libcurl that doesn't suffer from the defect
fixed by http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975858. This defect causes an error
message "schannel: failed to setup extended errors".

On all platforms: show some additional libraries' versions in the about screen

Correct a defect when tqsl is used as a command line tool to sign a user's log
for their logging program. If while signing that log, tqsl detected that a
newer version of tqsl was available, it would exit without signing or
uploading those QSOs.

1.14.2
------
Fixed an error when the TrustedQSL directory had Unicode characters, don't
prompt for updates when called silently, fail properly when the user chooses
to not ignore signing errors

1.14.1
------
Minor bug fixes to internet functions and the command line parser, hang fixed
on OSX, removed unnecessary field from upload

1.14
----
Major feature additions:

 - Upload log files directly from TrustedQSL! Simply choose "sign and upload"
   from the File menu and your log will signed and uploaded automatically with
   no extra work.

 - Command line flag '-u' has been added to expose this functionality to
   tools authors.
 - The return value from tqsl can be used to determine whether the signing
   or upload succeeded or failed, and why

          0=success; log signed and uploaded and accepted without incident
          1=Cancelled by user
          2=The log was rejected by the LoTW server
          3=The response from the LoTW server was unexpected or unrecognized
          4=An error occurred in tqsl
          5=An error occurred in tqsllib (probably a bad filename)
          6=Unable to open input file
          7=Unable to open output file
          8=All QSOs were duplicate or out of date range (no QSOs written)
          9=Some QSOs were duplicate or out of date range (some QSOs written)
          10=Command syntax error
          11=LoTW network connection failed (no network or LoTW is unreachable)

   The exit status is also written to Standard Error (stderr) in an easily
   recognized format.

 - Automatically check for updates. If a new version is available, you will be
   periodically prompted to download and install it. You can also check manually

 - Duplicate checking. Any QSOs that have been successfully uploaded to Logbook
   of the World or saved to a file are registered in a database. Any exact
   duplicates are automatically stripped from future logs. This can be disabled
   on a case-by-case basis, in case a log was signed but never uploaded, or
   there was a server issue that led to an upload going unprocessed.

 - TQSL will now ensure that the CQ and ITU zones, and subdivisions if any
   (US state/county, Canadian province, Russian oblast) are valid with respect
   to each other. This should reduce the incidence of swapped CQ/ITU zones and
   in general should help ensure that more accurate location data is uploaded.
   When an attempt is made to use a location with errors (such as CQ/ITU
   zones being reversed) the user is notified to correct the errors.

 - Installer on Windows is now a Microsoft Windows Installer package, instead of
   an executable. This will allow for easier and cleaner upgrades

 - Added a new command line option, '-a', to allow command line users to
   control user interaction. This option takes a value from the set ask,
   abort, compliant, or all. For '-a ask', TQSL will ask users how to handle
   duplicates and date mismatches. '-a abort' will cause signing to terminate
   immediately when an error occurs. '-a compliant' will cause only correct
   (new or in date range) records to be output, and '-a all' will cause all
   of the input records (including duplicates) to be signed. Prompts for errors
   (date ranges bad, bad callsigns) will be suppressed for '-a compliant'
   or '-a all', but cause immediate aborts when '-a abort' is used. '-a ask'
   prompts the user in those cases.

Minor changes:

 - TQSL/TQSLCERT now have window icons

 - Double-clicking an entry in the "Choose station location" window for signing
   now selects it, instead of opening it for editing

 - Command line parsing has been rewritten and should be more robust. Also,
   command-line documentation is available with '-h'

 - Files to sign and save are now prompted before location and date range

 - The build number is now shown in the About box; please include this when
   asking for help

 - The final confirmation before signing includes the signing station location

 - Output files on Unix systems are provided with a default .tq8 extension

 - The "Edit station location" window title now contains the callsign and
   station location name

 - Station locations can no longer be defined using expired or superseded
   certificates

 - Users are no longer prompted for a password while importing a .p12 file
   unless the file has a password set

 - When importing a certificate, detailed information is provided on the
   progress of the operation as well as the reason for any errors

 - Dozens of bug fixes and potential or real crashes fixed.

TQSL/TQSLCERT and the rest of TrustedQSL now built with the CMake build system

TQSL/TQSLCERT are now built with MSVC on Windows.

** Windows 98 support has been dropped. This will be one of the last releases

<H3>Summary&nbsp;&nbsp; </H3>
<P>The TrustedQSL C API is a set of C++ methods with an ANSI 
C calling interface.&nbsp; The API has both high level and low level 
functions.&nbsp; For our purposes the differences being that low level functions 
are called by the high level functions.&nbsp; For the most part the application 
programmer doesn't need to call the low level functions unless they wish to 
mimic a high level function.&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible example might be create a 
new trusted file format or validating TrustedQSL from&nbsp;a database. </P>

<P><STRONG>PKI Discussion</STRONG></P>
<P>==============</P>
<P>When a certificate request is generated, the key pair is stored in a file in 
the key ring directory, with the private key encrypted via an operator-supplied 
pass phrase.</P>
<P>There are three certificate files in the certificate store: a file containing 
user certificates, a file containing CA certificates, and a file containing 
trusted (root) certificates.</P>
<P>When a certificate file is received, the root and CA certificates are first 
saved in their respective files. Then any user certificates are stored iff (1) 
their signatures can be verified using the available CA and root certificates, 
and (2) the public key in the certificate matches a key pair that's in the key 
ring. Matching user certificates are saved in the user-certificate file.</P>
<P>Note that certificates are opaque objects at the API level. And the 
application program never messes with -- or even sees -- the key pairs. It just 
passes the certificate objects supplied by tqsl_selectCertificates back to the 
library when it needs to sign or verify something, and the library takes care of 
selecting the private key needed.</P>
<P>Another detail that probably bears mention is that if a root certificate is 
being added, the operator should be prompted to accept it.</P>
<P>By the way, the code for a good chunk of the above is written and partially 
tested. :-)</P>
<P><STRONG>Signing Discussion</STRONG></P>
<P>==================</P>
<P>I don't think functions to sign ADIF or Cabrillo file belong in the core tQSL 
library. A separate utility (or library) that uses the tQSL library to convert 
an ADIF or Cabrillo file to Gabbi would be better. As several people have 
pointed out, ADIF is something of a moving target whose future direction is 
uncertain. To a lesser degree, the same is true of Cabrillo. It would be better 
to separate those functions from the core library IMHO.</P>
<P>We also need additional functions to create the Gabbi file of QSLs. Here's my 
cut:</P>
<P>&lt; P &gt; &nbsp; </P>
<P></P>
<P>The application wanting to create a Gabbi submission of a log would do 
something like:</P>
<P>tQSL_Gabbi *g = tqsl_beginGabbi(&lt;initialization parameters&gt;);</P><PRE></PRE>
<P>&lt;build station record&gt;</P>
<P>tQSL_Cert **c = tqsl_selectCertificate(callsign, &lt;qso date from first log 
record&gt;, NULL);</P>
<P>if (&lt;number_of_certs&gt; &gt; 1) </P>
<P>{</P>
<P>&lt;select issuer to use for signing&gt;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>tqsl_Cert *cur_c = NULL;</P>
<P>for &lt;each_log_record&gt; {</P>
<P>&lt;build contact record&gt;</P>
<P>if (cur_c != NULL) {</P>
<P>if (!tqsl_checkCertificate(cur_c, callsign, qso_date)) {</P>
<P>tqsl_freeCertificate(cur_c);</P>
<P>cur_c = NULL;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>if (cur_c == NULL) {</P>
<P>tqsl_Cert **c = tqsl_selectCertificates(callsign, qso_date, issuer);</P>
<P>if (*c == NULL) {</P>
<P>&lt;no matching certs - can't sign this record&gt;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>cur_c = *c;</P>
<P>tqsl_beginSignVerify(cur_c);</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>tqsl_addGabbiQSLRecord(g, station, contact, cur_c);</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>tqsl_endGabbi();</P>
<P>if (cur_c != NULL) {</P>
<P>tqsl_freeCertificate(cur_c);</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>That leaves out quite a bit of detail, of course, but it shows the program 
flow as seen by the application.<STRONG>List of Functions and data structures.</STRONG> </P>
<P>All functions of the TrustedQSL API will be prefixed with tqsl_ and data 
structures will be prefixed with tQSL_. The C API will be only a set up of C 
wrappers for C++ class which will do the work. Data objects are opaque objects 
which can't be access except thru TrustedQSL functions. </P>
<H1 align=center>Function categories</H1>
<H2 align=center>PKI functions: </H2>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_beginSignVerify(cert)</STRONG> - 
Using a callback to get the password, decrypts a copy of the private key which 
is kept in memory. (If has already been called with no intervening tqsl_endSignVerify, this becomes a 
no-op.)</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_checkCertificate(cert, callsign, qso_date)</STRONG> - 
Returns TRUE if cert is valid for signing a QSO with the specified callsign and 
QSO date</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tsql_createCertReq()</STRONG> - Generate key pair and 
certificate request file to send to CA. Uses a callback to get encryption pass 
phrase.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_endSignVerify(cert)</STRONG> - Blanks (zeroes) the 
copy of the unencrypted private key in memory.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tsql_freeCertificate(cert)</STRONG> - Frees any resources 
acquired by the library for the certificate object. Certificate object must not 
be used after this call. Implicitly calls <EM>tsql_endSignVerify</EM>.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_importCertFile()</STRONG> - Import a file of 
certificates. The file may consist of user, CA and/or root certificates. (See 
discussion below.)</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_readCert()</STRONG> - Low level function, maybe private 
to API. Read Certificate (and add to 
certificate key ring ?)</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_readPrivateKey()</STRONG> - Low level, and may use call back to 
vendor function.&nbsp; Read&nbsp;a private key from private key ring.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_rsaGenKey()</STRONG> - Create a RSA key pair.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_writePrivateKey()</STRONG> - Write&nbsp;a private key 
to private key ring.&nbsp; Call back for pass phrase.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_selectCertificates(callsign, qso_date, issuer, 
with_expired)</STRONG> - Select one or more matching user certificates. Only 
active certs are returned unless with_expired == TRUE. If all three selection 
parameters are supplied and with_expired == FALSE, either 0 or 1 certificate 
will be returned: a certificate that can be used to sign a QSO with those 
parameters.</P>
<P><STRONG>tqsl_sign*</STRONG> - TBD singing functions.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_signQSLRecord</STRONG>(tStation *, tContact *,tKeys *) - Low level function 
to sign a QSL record.&nbsp; This will call the low level function <EM>tqsl_sign 
</EM>and <EM>tqsl_verify</EM>    
  . </P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_validateTQSLRecord*</STRONG> - Low level function to 
 validates a trustedQSL record.</P>
<H2 align=center>Gabbi Signing Functions</H2>
<P align=left><STRONG>tQSL_Gabbi g = 
tqsl_beginGabbi()</STRONG> - Initializes the Gabbi output. (What this exactly

Have to set up the output stream/file, too.)</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_addGabbiQSLRecord(tQSL_Gabbi*, tQSL_Station*, 
tQSL_Contact*, tQSL_Cert*)</STRONG> - Forms GABBI station, contact (w/signature) 
and cert records, as needed, and outputs them.&nbsp;This calls the low level 
function&nbsp;<EM>tqsl_signQSLRecord</EM>.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_endGabbi(tQSL_Gabbi*)</STRONG> - Cleans up the Gabbi 
output.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_validateGabbiQslFile</STRONG>(inputfile)&nbsp; - Read 
a Gabbi file and validate the tQSL information.&nbsp; Calls the low level 
function <EM>tqsl_validateTQSLRecord.</EM></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_validateGabbiEnumFile(inputfile)</STRONG> - Read and 
validate a Gabbi format enum file.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>tqsl_validateGabbiSigListFile(inputfile)</STRONG> - Read

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
The  mission of the Trusted QSL Group is to keep QSL and E-QSL open and free activities 
for amateur radio operators by promoting Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). 


<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<P align=left>Our goal is to set the standards and create computer API 
libraries and the tools required to implement the Trusted DSA model.&nbsp; The 
standards and source codes will be licensed using the Lessor GNU Public 
License.&nbsp; 
<p>

<p>
<b>Currently there are two ways to handle E-QSL:</b>
<br>
<b>1.</b>The Central Logbook model which grants you access to a central logbook server 
via a trusted process.
<br>
<b>2.</b> DSA. In this case a trusted third
 party assigns you a unique public key which allows you to sign any number of messages. 

<P>The Trusted QSL Group supports the DSA process.  We don't think that a 
central logbook server is in keeping with the sprit of 
amateur radio because it requires a large trusted central staff to maintain 
it.&nbsp; Also in the words of "Highlander"&nbsp; there can only be one.&nbsp; 
If there were more than one QSL processing server, then an amateur would have
 to join them all to insure that their contacts received credit. If 
there is only one then there could be no competition  for the service.&nbsp; We 
feel that this is a very BAD thing.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>Using an open standard with open sources for a PKDS provides a 
model which no single entity can become the end all of trusted QSL.&nbsp; Any 
group wishing to become a Certification Authority (CA) can do so.&nbsp; The 
trust of that CA lies in the award sponsor.&nbsp; Award sponsors may have 
requirements for the CA to meet before they become trusted.&nbsp; This is as it 
should be.&nbsp; We envision a very large number of CAs being formed to meet the 
needs of the Amateurs.</P>

This means that you can use it for how every you wish as 
long as you do not attempt to prevent others from doing the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This doesn't prevent log book authors from using the libraries and then make 
money off of them.&nbsp; The only sources that they would be required to release 
on demand would the sources to the libraries.&nbsp; This could be done by 
pointing them to our web site.</P>

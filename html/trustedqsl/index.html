<h2>Our Mission</h2>
The  mission of the Trusted QSL Group is to keep QSL and E-QSL open and free activities 
for amateur radio operators by promoting Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). 


<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<P align=left> Our goal is to set the standards and create computer 
API libraries and the tools required to implement the Trusted DSA model.&nbsp; 
The standards and source codes will be licensed using the Opening Source 
License.&nbsp;

<P align=left>TrustedQSL is an open source licenses, this means that you can use it for how every you wish as long as 
you do not attempt to prevent others from doing the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
doesn't prevent log book authors from using the libraries and then make money 
off of them.&nbsp; The only sources that they would be required to release on 
demand would the sources to the libraries.&nbsp; This could be done by pointing 
them to our web site.</P>

<b>Authentication</b> - Being able to validate that a 
messages is from who it claims to be from. An intruder should not be able to 
masquerade as someone else.<br> <br> 
<B>Big Numbers</B> - Very large numbers 
used in digital encryption and signatures. Big numbers those larger than 2^128 or 128 bits integer. For
comparison the number  of atoms in the planet(Earth) is 2^170 or 170 bits integer.<br><br> 
<b>CA</b> - Certifying Authority<br><br> 
<b>Cert</b> - Short for certificate<br><br> 
<b>Certificate</b> - A special format of a public key which has been signed by a Certifying Authority<br><br> 
<b>Certifying Authority</b> - A trusted entity that signs public keys<br><br> 
<b>Digital Signature</b> - A special hash or signature which is create using the private key and can
only be validate using the matching public key.<br><br> 
<b>Gabbi</b> - Global Amateur Interchange format.  This is the format that logbooks 
use to send tQSL data to LoTW servers.<br><br> 
<b>Integrity</b> - Being able to validate that the message hasn't been altered.<br><br> 
<b>Message</b> - Any message or data that is to be signed, such a QSL or public key<br><br> 
<b>Nonredudiation</b> - A sender should not be able to falsely deny later that he sent a message.<br><br> 
<b>PKDS</b>  
    - Public Key Digital Signature.&nbsp;</P><SUP></SUP><SUP></SUP>
<P><STRONG>PKI</STRONG> - Public Key Infrastructure.&nbsp; Because of the trust 
is require in using a PK system it requires a complex infrastructure which is 
called PKI.<br> <br>
<b>Prime Numbers</b> - Numbers that can only be divided by by itself and 1.<br><br> 
<b>Principal</b> - The person originating the message<br> <br> 
<b>Private key</b> - A key which is used to sign messages which must be kept private<br><br> 
<b>Public key</b> - A key which can only be used to validate messages which has been signed with
the matching private key.<br><br> 
<b>Secret key</b> - A key which is used in single key encryption systems. A private key 
should be stored encrypted with a secret key.<br> <br></P> 
<P>Because this digital signature and encryption protocols has many players 
standard names call dramatic personae have been given to them.&nbsp; Because we are only concern with digital signatures  and certificates has been
shorten to include only those we need.<br></P>

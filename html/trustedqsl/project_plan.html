	<title>TrustedQSL Project Plan and Requirements</title>
</head>

<body>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The goal of the TrustedQSL project is to provide an open source API and frame 
work to support the exchange of signed digital QSL called TrustedQSLs or tQSLs 
for short.&nbsp; This includes the tools for implement a PKI (Public Key 
Infrastructure) based upon the OpenSSL crypto library.&nbsp; Soon after the 
project started ARRL contact us about using TrustedQSL as the client/PKI library 
for the Logbook Of The World project.&nbsp;&nbsp; We worked out our minor 
difference in the design concept and agreed to work together.&nbsp; The rest is 
history as they say.&nbsp; Now the question is where do we go from here?&nbsp; I 
have carved up the project in what I believe is a good grouping of 
subprojects.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The rest of the document will talk about the different subproject TrustedQSL 
project.</P>
<H2>Trusted Gabbi (Global Amateur Interchange)&nbsp; Formats </H2>
<H3>Discussion:</H3>
<P> <br>There are currently many 
different interchange formats that are being used by amateur radio today. By far 
the most popular is <A href="http://www.hosenose.com/adif">ADIF (Amateur Data 
Interchange Format) </A>for good reason. It is a very elegant, robust, and easy 
to read as raw data. It has many of the features found in XML without the need 
for special libraries and their associated learning curve. Having said that ADIF 
does have a short coming. It doesn't have any concept of record type. Today 
discussions with the ADIF development group hasn't been fruitful. Therefore to 
meet the requires of this project the standard must be forked. The new standard 
will be called XADIF. It is hoped that the two standards will be merged at some 
point in the future. Therefore a design goal is for Gabbi (Global Amateur 
Interchange) format to be backward compatible with ADIF. This turns 
out to be fairly easy to do by declaring the QSO/Logbook record as the default 
record type.</P>
<H3>Requirements:</H3>
<UL>
	<li>RecType Field.  This field will determine the record type
	<li>        
                
              
    An algorithm for determining the signing order of the fields must be specified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <LI>In addition the currently define QSO/Logbook record, QSL and Station 
  Records must be defined.
  <LI>Field definitions is only significant to that record.&nbsp; For example a 
  GRID_SQUARE field on a QSO would refer to the contact station grid 
  square.&nbsp; GRID_SQUARE on a station record would refer to the grid square 
  of the station submitting the QSL
  <LI>A new field or possibly as well define virtual field 
  (ie: call and number of seconds since epoch) which can be common to all records and required for tQSL 
  records will be the GUID (<STRONG>G</STRONG>lobal <STRONG>U</STRONG>nique 
  <STRONG>ID</STRONG>           
          entifier).&nbsp; This is in 
  order that different records can be uniquely connected to other records in 
  a portable and database independent way.
  <LI>           
              
            C/C++ functions 
  that parse and create record strings.
  <LI>        
      Create a memory object that can store and sign a 
  record.</LI></UL>
<H3>Task:</H3>

<ol>
<li>Define specification for tQSL Records
<li>Define specification for a trusted QTH/station record
<li>Define specification Trusted Delegation record 
  (deferred) 
  <LI>Create functions and/or class to parse, format, read and write Gabbi 
  records.
  <LI>Create API usage document for #4</LI>
 </ol>
<H2>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Functions</H2>
<H3>Discussion:</H3>
<P>The PKI functions is the heart of TrustedQSL.&nbsp; It 
allows LoTW and others to authenticate&nbsp;tQSL using public key digital 
signature PKDS technology PKI are by there very nature complex 
and many of the policy issues are address by the LoTW design 
document.&nbsp; The scope of this document is to provide the API 
functions required to support a PKI such as LoTW will require.&nbsp; 
It is beyond the scope of this project to define any of the 
procedures or policies for the operation of a 
CA. </P>
<P>Currently most PKDS uses the RSA encryption Algorithm, however in many 
countries the use of strong encryption software is illegal to 
use, own, import and/or export.&nbsp; Because of this the initial release 
will use the DSS (Digital Signature Standard) for created and authentication of 
digital signatures.&nbsp; The low level design will be able to support RSA in 
the event that laws change such as would permit the free use of RSA.  DSA 
(Digital Signature Algorithms) claims to be able to be used for digital 
signatures, therefore there is no known restrictions placed on it by any 
government.</P>
<P>PKDS are relative simple in nature requiring only basic 
math to compute.&nbsp; What makes PKDS complex and hard to deal with is the uses 
of big numbers.&nbsp; Most computers today are 32 bits, some are 64 bits 
and a few special purpose computers are 128 bits.&nbsp; The smallest number used 
by DSA is 160 bits and goes up to 1024 bits.&nbsp; Therefore it takes special 
routines to deal with these big numbers.&nbsp; Fortunately another open 
source project <A href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</A> has taken care of 
all the low level work.&nbsp; There is two important things that makes the 
OpenSSL project appealing.&nbsp; 1) The licenses does plan any restrictions on product that uses 
any of the OpenSSL libraries, unlike the GPL license that requires the release of all 
source.&nbsp; 2) It is native C code and has been ported to every 
major platform/OS including Win32, Mac, Linux and Unix.&nbsp; It doesn't not however support 16 
bit OS such as MS-DOS.&nbsp; Also there is no direct support for Java.&nbsp; It 
is believed that Java support can be done with 
some of the encryption class that are available for Java. </P>
<H3>Task:&nbsp;</H3>
<ol>
<li>Crypto support libraries and ports.<br>
The OpenSSL library is in itself a large library.  Most of the functions provide
by the OpenSSL crypto library will not be used by TrustedQSL.  To make it as simple as
possible for software vendors, the library should be reduce to a subset of functions that
will be used directly or indirectly by TrustedQSL API.  This is most important for Win32
platform because of the large base of users, but should also be done for Mac as
well.  Linux isn't a issue because OpenSSL comes fairly standard on Linux or can
be compiled and installed without any trouble.

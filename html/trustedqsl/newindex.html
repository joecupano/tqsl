<h2>Our Mission</h2>
  The mission of the TrustedQSL Group is to keep QSL and E-QSL open and free activities 
for amateur radio operators by promoting Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). 


<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<P align=left>Our goal is to set the standards and create computer API 
libraries and the tools required to implement the Trusted DSA model.&nbsp; The 
standards and source codes will be licensed using the Lessor GNU Public 
License.&nbsp; 
<p>

<p>
<b>Currently there are two ways to handle E-QSL:</b>
<br>
<b>1.</b>The Central Logbook model which grants you access to a central logbook server 
via a trusted process.
<br>
<b>2.</b> DSA. In 
this case a trusted third party signs you a unique public key that becomes a 
certificate.&nbsp; This allows the prinacpal to sign other messages with his 
private key that can only be validated with the signed certificate.&nbsp; Just 
like a notary public does care or try to validate what
 you signed just that it was indeed you that signed it.&nbsp; Certificates perform the same functions. 

<P>The Trusted QSL Group supports the DSA process.  We don't think that a 
central logbook server is in keeping with the sprit of 
amateur radio because it requires a large trusted central staff to maintain 
it.&nbsp; Also in the words of "Highlander"&nbsp; there can only be one.&nbsp; 
If there were more than one QSL processing server, then an amateur would have
 to join them all to insure that their contacts received credit. If 
there is only one then there could be no competition  for the service.&nbsp; We 
feel that this is a very BAD thing.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>Using an open standard with open sources for a PKDS provides a 
model which no single entity can become the end all of trusted QSL.&nbsp; Any 
group wishing to become a Certification Authority (CA) can do so.&nbsp; The 
trust of that CA lies in the award sponsor.&nbsp; Award sponsors may have 
requirements for the CA to meet before they become trusted.&nbsp; This is as it 
should be.&nbsp; We envision a very large number of CAs being formed to meet the 
needs of the Amateurs.</P>This means that you can use it for how every 
you wish as long as you do not attempt to prevent others from doing the 
same.&nbsp;&nbsp; This doesn't prevent log book authors from using the libraries 
and then make money off of them.&nbsp; The only sources that they would be 
required to release on demand would the sources to the libraries.&nbsp; This 
could be done by pointing them to our web site.

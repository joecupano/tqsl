<OL type=I>
<LI>Built-In (or Spec Defined) Signed Field
 <UL type=disc>
<li>The name of this field is included in a TBD list of field 
names defined in the Gabbi specification.</<LI> 
 
<li>Value of this field is incorporated into "virtual 
    record" used for calculating digital signature 
    
<li>External representations of the value of this field 
    shall be encoded using a TBD set of formatting rules given in the Gabbi 
    
<li>The formatting rules must result in an unambiguous 
    bi-directionalmapping between a data value and its unique external 
    represestation. 
    
<li>Database design must save the value of this field. 
    
<li>Database design may employ internal representations 
    for storing the value of the field that differ from the external 
    representation. E.g., numeric values maye be stored as a binary number 
    rather than as a string of digit characters. 
    
<li>Only ASCII characters shall be used in field name 
    and in the external representation of the value of this field [TBR] 
    <P></P>           
         
</li>
</UL>
<LI>Built-In (or Spec Defined) Unsigned Field 
   <UL type=disc>
 <li>The name of this field is included in a TBD list of 
    field names defined in the Gabbi specification. 
    
<li>Field name shall also employ a TBD mechanism 
    designating this as an "unsigned" field 
    
<li>Value of field is omitted from the "virtual record" 
    used for calculating digital signature 
    
<li>Database design may decline to save this field 
    
<li>Only ASCII characters shall be used in field name 
    
<li>Any valid Unicode characters may be used in the 
    field value [TBR] 
        </li>
</UL>
<p></p>
<LI>User Defined Signed Field
  <UL type=disc>
<li>Field name is not in the union of the lists of 
    signed and unsigned fields defined in the Gabbi spec 
    
<li>Value of field incorporated into "virtual record" 
    for calculating digital signature 
    
<li>Database design must save the unprocessed octet 
    strings representing this field's name and its value. These strings shall be 
    saved in the functional equivalent of a table 
    
<li>Any valid Unicode characters may be used in the 
    field name and field value [TBR] 
    <P></P>           
  
  </li>
  </UL>
  
<LI>User Defined Unsigned Field
   <UL type=disc>
<li>Field name is not in the union of the lists of 
    signed and unsigned fields defined in the Gabbi specification 
    
<li>Field name shall also employ a TBD mechanism 
    designating this as an "unsigned" field 
    
<li>Value of field is omitted from the "virtual record" 
    used for calculating digital signature 
    
<li>Database design may decline to save this field 
    
<li>Any valid Unicode characters may be used in the field name 
and field value [TBR]</li>
